# WomenTechstersCapstone
Capstone Project in the framework of the Women Techsters Fellowship Program by Tech4dev



This Project is about a recruitment web app that helps the recruitment of skilled trades, (eg. electricians, carpenter, plumbers) for companies.
The main goal is to tackle with skills shortage: there is a shortage of skilled tradespeople, particularly in certain industries and geographic regions. By providing a platform to connect companies with skilled trades, we addressed this issue and ensure that businesses have access to the talent they need.

To integrate a Blockchain solution in the Web app, the idea of an ERC20 Token creation came up in order to provide a mean for people to support the  recruitment platform.
